# Promises

ES6 brings to the standard JavaScript specification a new feature Promises (a feature available
in some of the new and latest JS libraries and frameworks) that solves many of the
significant problems in the callbacks â€“ the only approach to async.

```
func1(function (value1) {
    func2(value1, function (value2) {
        func3(value2, function (value3) {
            func4(value3, function (value4) {
                func5(value4, function (value5) {
                    // Do something with value 5
                });
            });
        });
    });
});
```

Prior to ES6, you could have asynchronously fetched x and then passed it as an
argument to fetch y and similarly for z, using callbacks as follows:

```
func1(value1)
  .then(func2)
  .then(func3)
  .then(func4)
  .then(func5, value5 => {
      // Do something with value 5
  });
```

Here is a practical example of using Promises:

```
var request = require('request');

return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  request.get(url, (error, response, body) => {
    if (body) {
        resolve(JSON.parse(body));
      } else {
        resolve({});
      }
  });
});

```

We can also parallelize Promises to handle an array of asynchronous operations by using Promise.all():

```
let urls = [
  '/api/commits',
  '/api/issues/opened',
  '/api/issues/assigned',
  '/api/issues/completed',
  '/api/issues/comments',
  '/api/pullrequests'
];

let promises = urls.map((url) => {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    $.ajax({ url: url })
      .done((data) => {
        resolve(data);
      });
  });
});

Promise.all(promises)
  .then((results) => {
    // Do something with results of all our promises
 });

```
Benefits of Promises: Error Handling using a bunch of nested callbacks can get chaotic. Using Promises, we have a clear path to bubbling errors up and handling them appropriately. Moreover, the value of a Promise after it has been resolved/rejected is immutable - it will never change.
